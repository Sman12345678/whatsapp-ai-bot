# Quick GitHub Push Guide

Your project is already set up with Git! Here's how to push it to GitHub:

## 1. Create GitHub Repository
- Go to github.com and create a new repository
- Name it something like `whatsapp-ai-bot`
- Don't initialize with README (you already have one)

## 2. Add GitHub as Remote
In the Replit shell, run:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
```

## 3. Push Your Code
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

That's it! Your code is now on GitHub.

## If You Need to Update Later
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your update message"
git push
```

## Important Notes
- Your `.env` file won't be uploaded (it's in `.gitignore`)
- This protects your API keys and secrets
- Anyone who clones your repo will need their own `.env` file
